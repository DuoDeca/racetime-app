Hello {{ user.name }},

The category you requested has just been added to the site:

    {{ category_url }}

Now anyone may create {{ category.short_name }} races on {{ site_info.title }}. Time to get racing!

You have been given ownership of this category by default, this will allow you
to manage the category goals, moderators, and other details. You can transfer
the category ownership to another user if you don't want/need this ability.

If you need any help with category management, feel free to ask for assistance
in our Discord.

GG,

The {{ site_info.title }} team
